#Heaps: Homework

We are required to implement the array-based representation of binary heap, with an iterative version of HEAPIFY.

The functions implemented for the binary heap are the ones shown in the slides.

The binary heap implemented here is a **min-heap**; the "specular" implementation of a **max-heap** is contained in the folder *Sorting/HeapSort*.

*minheap_main.c* tests the correctness of the implementation and evaluates the execution time required to build a binary heap (*build_heap* function).

A Makefile is provided.
