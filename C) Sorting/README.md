# Sorting: Homework

We are required to implement:
• **Insertion Sort**;
• **Quick Sort**;
• **Heap Sort**;
• **Counting Sort**;
• **Radix Sort**;
• **Bucket Sort**;
• **Select Algorithm**.

The implementation of each algorithm is contained in a dedicated subfolder, together with a *main* which tests the correctness of the implementation and evaluates the execution time on a set of instances; a Makefile is provided in each case.

In particular, the performance tests for Insertion Sort and Quick Sort consider separately the worst case and the best case scenarios in order to show that:
- in the worst case, both Insertion Sort and Quick Sort take time O(n^2);
- in the best case, Insertion Sort and Quick Sort take time O(n) and O(n*logn), respectively.
