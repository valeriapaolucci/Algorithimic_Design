# Weighted Graphs: Homework

We are required to:
• Implement the **array-based** version of the Dijkstra’s algorithm (folder *Array-based*);
• Implement the **binary heap-based** version of the Dijkstra’s algorithm (folder *Heap-based*).

For simplicity, in both cases the adjacency matrix representation of the graph has been chosen.

A Makefile is provided in both the folders.
